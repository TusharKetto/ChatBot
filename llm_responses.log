Query: Adhaar e-verification not working
Response: I understand you're experiencing issues with Aadhaar e-verification. While Ketto uses Aadhaar as part of its KYC and verification process for campaigners, here's what you can do if the e-verification isn't working:

1.  **Double-check your details:** Ensure the Aadhaar number and any linked mobile number (for OTPs, if applicable) are correct and that the details match your Aadhaar record.
2.  **Try again later:** Sometimes, e-verification services can face temporary technical difficulties.
3.  **Check your internet connection:** A stable connection is often required.

If the problem continues, please don't worry. Ketto has a team that reviews documents. You can:
*   **Look for alternative verification options** if provided during the process.
*   **Contact Ketto Support directly.** They can assist you with the verification process, troubleshoot the issue, or guide you on how to submit your documents for manual review if the e-verification continues to fail. Ketto Executives review submitted information and can get in touch for further discussion if needed.

Query: I want to give food today to street dogs and more street animal so i want 2k rupee fund
Response: That's a wonderful and compassionate goal! Ketto is a great platform to help you raise the ₹2000 to feed street animals. Here's how you can get started:

1.  **Start your Fundraiser on Ketto:** You can begin by setting up a fundraiser for FREE on the Ketto website.
2.  **Set Your Target Amount:** Your target is ₹2000, which is clear.
3.  **Write Your Story:** This is very important. Explain:
    *   **Why:** You want to provide food to street dogs and other animals.
    *   **Whom:** The street animals in your area who are in need.
    *   **Impact:** How the ₹2000 will be used (e.g., how much food it will buy, how many animals it could feed for the day).
    *   **About You:** Briefly share your passion for helping these animals.
    *   Use words that empower donors, showing them their contribution will make a real difference today. If you have any photos of the animals you plan to feed, include them!
4.  **Share Immediately (Crucial for "Today"):**
    *   **Personal Network:** Since you need the funds for today, immediately reach out to animal lovers in your personal network (friends, family, colleagues). Share your Ketto campaign link with them and explain the urgency. Getting a few initial donations can motivate others.
    *   **Online Sharing:** Share your campaign link on your social media, in animal lovers' groups, and forums.
5.  **Tax Benefits (Optional but helpful):** If you happen to be connected with an animal rescue NGO that has an 80G certificate, you could ask if they can help route the donations. This allows donors to claim tax benefits, which can be an incentive.

To get started quickly for today, focus on steps 1, 2, 3, and especially step 4 (reaching out to your immediate network). Good luck with your compassionate effort!

Query: Can I get International tax certificate from ketto
Response: The provided information does not explicitly state whether Ketto issues international tax certificates.

Tax regulations for charitable donations can be complex and vary significantly from country to country. Whether you can receive a tax certificate for an international donation often depends on:
1.  The legal and tax-exempt status of the specific campaigner or NGO in your country of residence.
2.  Your local tax laws regarding donations to foreign entities.

For the most accurate information, I recommend:
*   Checking Ketto's official website or help section for more details on international donations and tax receipts.
*   Contacting Ketto support directly at support@Ketto.org.
*   Inquiring with the specific fundraiser or NGO you donated to, as they would be responsible for issuing any applicable tax documentation based on their legal status and your country's regulations.

Query: qhat went wrong
Response: It's difficult to say exactly what went wrong without more specific details about your situation.

However, based on the information provided, Ketto has outlined several acts that people linked with the platform should avoid. These actions could be considered "what went wrong" if they occurred. These include:

*   **Providing incomplete, false, or suspicious information**, or not complying with identification requirements.
*   **Suspicious payment activities**, such as:
    *   Payments made only in cash or cash equivalents.
    *   Unusually large donations inconsistent with normal patterns without a legitimate reason.
    *   Requests for payments to be made in unrelated countries or to third parties.
    *   Multiple partial payments from various parties for a single user or from various locations.
    *   Making payments in one form and then requesting refunds in other forms (e.g., credit card payment, cash refund request).
    *   Making contributions followed by immediate requests to wire out or transfer funds to a third party without a connected purpose.
    *   Requesting donations to be paid in cash or wired to a third party without a connected purpose.
*   **Attempts to avoid reporting requirements** or refusing to maintain required records.
*   **Users appearing as agents or representatives for others** but refusing to provide complete information about those individuals or organizations.
*   **On-boarding of users by Ketto employees based on incomplete information** or against Ketto’s policies.

If you have encountered a specific issue or have concerns about a particular transaction, fundraiser, or interaction, please provide more details so I can offer more targeted assistance.
