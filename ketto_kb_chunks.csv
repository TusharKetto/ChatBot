have helped save over 1.4 lakh lives since its inception in 2012. People who thought they wouldn’t be able to survive owing to mounting medical bills made it, thanks to Ketto’s SIP and its benevolent donors.
Anthony:
When Anthony was a year old, he required a transplant that cost around Rs. 16.50 lakhs. His mother, a housekeeper, couldn’t afford the expenses and only hoped for a miracle. Thanks to Ketto’s Social Impact Plan, Anthony, and his mother were successfully able to arrange funds for his transplant, and today, Anthony is just like any other kid, happy and playful.
Balu:
Balu comes from a family of daily wagers; and so, affording world-class treatment at a hospital seemed to be a luxury for them. When Balu was diagnosed with cancer and needed over 15 lakhs for chemotherapy, his parents knew they couldn’t save him. However, thanks to the efforts of the donors at Ketto, Balu’s family raised money on time, and today, Balu is a hale and hearty child.
Aashiya:
Four-year-old Aashiya had been suffering from hearing problems for a very long time, and everyone thought that she wouldn’t be able to hear properly in her life. However, with the help of Ketto’s fundraising campaign, Aashiya’s family secured funds of over 8 lakhs and successfully managed to get a cochlear implant for her. Now, Aashiya can hear and talk like any other human being.

When Sai Shree was a year old, she had been diagnosed with cancer. It seemed impossible for her family to pay 15 lakhs for her chemotherapy, as her father had just lost his job. Thanks to Ketto, many donors stepped up and paid for her treatment. Today, Sai Shree is on her road to recovery.

Ketto’s crowdfunding campaigns

have helped save over 1.4 lakh lives since its inception in 2012. People who thought they wouldn’t be able to survive owing to mounting medical bills made it, thanks to Ketto’s SIP and its benevolent donors.

Anthony:

When Anthony was a year old, he required a transplant that cost around Rs. 16.50 lakhs. His mother, a housekeeper, couldn’t afford the expenses and only hoped for a miracle. Thanks to Ketto’s Social Impact Plan, Anthony, and his mother were successfully able to arrange funds for his transplant, and today, Anthony is just like any other kid, happy and playful.

Balu:

Balu comes from a family of daily wagers; and so, affording world-class treatment at a hospital seemed to be a luxury for them. When Balu was diagnosed with cancer and needed over 15 lakhs for chemotherapy, his parents knew they couldn’t save him. However, thanks to the efforts of the donors at Ketto, Balu’s family raised money on time, and today, Balu is a hale and hearty child.

It is the practice of raising money by seeking donations from several people who contribute towards a common cause. As teachers, crowdfunding can help you raise funds to buy classroom supplies, take your children to special field trips, build toilets in the school, provide daily meals, etc.
Until recently, the education sector in India has been slow to adopt crowdfunding. Today,
education crowdfunding
has become a common practice as more and more teachers from NGOs, shelter homes, and schools are utilising crowdfunding to raise funds and help their students learn better.
Now that you are aware of what crowdfunding is?
You must know how you can raise funds through crowdfunding.
While it can be tempting to start your crowdfunding campaign as fast as you can, it is advisable that you take your time to prepare a fundraising plan. The more time you spend before launching the campaign, the less time you would have to spend fixing the errors while the campaign is live.
The first step in starting a teacher crowdfunding campaign is to define a goal. You must determine for what purpose do you want to raise funds? How much do you want to raise? And set a feasible timeline for the campaign.
Once you are ready with the above details, the next step is to look for the best crowdfunding platform to host your campaign. There are many crowdfunding platforms in India, like Ketto, that hosts hundreds of campaigns. Make sure that you are familiar with how the crowdfunding platform works and choose the right platform to suit your needs.
After you have narrowed down your search on the
crowdfunding platform
, it is paramount
that you have a good narrative before you take the campaign live. Write a catchy caption for your campaign that can immediately draw the potential donor’s attention and give them a preview about the campaign. Provide details about why you are raising funds and how the donations can help the children learn better and become better citizens. You can add a few pictures of your students to emotionally connect with your donors.
After you have collected donations from the people, it would be wise to send a personal message to the donors and thank them for helping you make a difference in your students’ life.",0,"**Q: What is Crowdfunding?**

A lot of families enjoy eating at restaurants. It is a great way to spend quality time with loved ones. So, why not use this opportunity and make this family time a profitable one for your classroom. You can collaborate with any local restaurant to host an education crowdfunding night and use the proceeds to meet your classroom expenses.
You can also involve your children to design a special menu for the fundraiser night and allow them to showcase their unique talents to the guests at the restaurant. This may make the guests feel more interested in the cause, and they may offer to pay more than the actual price for the fundraiser.
Be decisive with your fundraiser planning and try to get the students involved as much as possible. This would help them learn a valuable lesson –
‘they should stand up for their cause.’

·       Begin by creating an attractive video. It is the prime way in which a startup can put its image out there for everyone to see. The video should be exciting enough to stir the attention of the viewers and get them excited about the product and service offerings of the startup.
·       A startup should aim to set a very realistic fundraising goal for the campaign. When a startup uses a very high goal, people may be less likely to donate towards it. However, setting the goal too low may also deter people from coming together to pool resources.
·       People are more likely to give something towards a campaign if they expect to get something in return. Offering rewards is a great way to offer incentives to people to support the startup. Rewards in this case should be something that people may be willing to get.

If you are affiliated to any animal rescue NGO with an 80G certificate, ask them if you can route the donations to their account.

This will incentivise the donors as they can get tax benefits due to the 80G certification

.

Reach out to animal lovers in your network. Get some commitments from them before your campaign goes live. When visitors see that others have donated as well, they feel more motivated to contribute.",193

Share the campaign link on forums, nature lovers’ social media groups, and comment on other relevant influencers’ posts with the connection.
Lastly, make sure you keep your donors updated with the progress of your campaign. Often, when they see that you are just a short amount away from meeting your goal, they may contribute more and bridge that gap!
As you take on this endeavour to save animals who need your love and care, ensure that you are taking care of yourself as well. After all, you cannot pour from an empty cup.

SMA is a rare, genetic disorder that affects the nervous system. It is caused by a mutation in the SMN1 gene, which results in a deficiency of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. This protein is essential for the development and function of motor neurons, which control muscle movement.
Zolgensma is a one-time treatment that is administered by a single intravenous infusion. It works by delivering a working copy of the SMN1 gene into the patient’s cells. This allows the cells to produce more SMN protein, which can help to improve muscle function and slow the progression of the disease.
Zolgensma was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2019 for the treatment of SMA in children under the age of two. It is the most expensive drug in the world, costing $2.125 million per dose.
Zolgensma has been shown to be effective in slowing the progression of SMA and improving the quality of life for patients. In a clinical trial, children who received Zolgensma at an average age of 6.9 months were able to sit independently for the first time at an average age of 14.5 months. They were also able to reach for objects and crawl at an earlier age than children who did not receive the treatment.
Zolgensma is not without risks. The most common side effects are fever, headache, and muscle weakness. Serious side effects, such as inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, can occur in rare cases.

In this stage, the campaigner has limited access to the product features and other crowdfunding benefits. Ketto verifies each and every medical fundraiser submitted on the platform. Only upon successful verification, Ketto approves the fundraiser and allows the campaigner to withdraw funds. A team of dedicated and professional compliance executives perform deep verification that includes
cross-checking medical reports submitted by the campaigner. In the event of the documents being incorrect/fake/invalid/forged, etc the team coordinates with the campaigner to make sure only recent and valid documents are submitted.
For the withdrawal process, Ketto primarily prefers to transfer funds to the patient Hospital’s account. In the circumstances wherein the hospital documents cannot be uploaded by the campaigner, the funds are only then transferred to the patient’s account. The verification here includes a basic Address, Bank and Pan KYC check.
To ensure the highest level of security, Ketto follows a 3 layer check in the payout compliance thus ensuring minimal fault events. Only once these checks are completed, the campaigner are then eligible to put a withdrawal request for the funds collected.
Post this step, the funds are transferred to the approved bank account within 2-5 business days.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the 'Cookies and other electronic technologies' section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our website, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the website. We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices
link
for EU based advertising or for US based advertising either: (i) the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
link
or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out
link
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
Unsolicited Information
Please be advised that some information you provide may be publicly accessible, such as information posted in forums or comment sections. We may also collect information through customer support communications, your communication to us of ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, with publicly-accessible information, ""Unsolicited Information""). By sending us Unsolicited Information, you further (a) agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Unsolicited Information, (b) acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Unsolicited Information already under consideration or in development, (c) grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the Unsolicited Information, and (iv) irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Ketto and its users any claims and assertions of any moral rights contained in such Unsolicited Information. This Unsolicited Information section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services. This Privacy Policy otherwise does not apply to any information collected by Ketto other than information collected through the Services.

Security
Ketto has implemented technical and organizational security measures to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to Ketto via the Internet.
Do-Not-Track Signals
Do Not Track (""DNT"") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics.

Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit.

We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the 'Cookies and other electronic technologies' section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our website, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the website. We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

for EU based advertising or for US based advertising either: (i) the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
link
or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out
link

Google Ads Settings page
.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

We may also collect information through customer support communications, your communication to us of ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, with publicly-accessible information, ""Unsolicited Information""). By sending us Unsolicited Information, you further (a) agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Unsolicited Information, (b) acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Unsolicited Information already under consideration or in development, (c) grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the Unsolicited Information, and (iv) irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Ketto and its users any claims and assertions of any moral rights contained in such Unsolicited Information.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the 'Cookies and other electronic technologies' section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above.

We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

Google Ads Settings page

Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

By sending us Unsolicited Information, you further (a) agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Unsolicited Information, (b) acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Unsolicited Information already under consideration or in development, (c) grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the Unsolicited Information, and (iv) irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Ketto and its users any claims and assertions of any moral rights contained in such Unsolicited Information.

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, similar event, or steps taken in anticipation of such events (e.g., due diligence in a transaction), user information may be part of the transferred assets.
Agents, Consultants, Vendors and Related Third Parties:
Ketto, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions on its behalf, and we may provide access to or share your information with these companies so they can perform services for us. Examples of such functions include marketing, mailing information, data storage, security, fraud preventions, payment processing, legal services, and maintaining databases.
Legal Requirements:
Ketto may access, disclose, transfer and preserve your information when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to: (i) comply with the law including with subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, and other legal process; and respond to inquiries or requests from government, regulatory, law enforcement, public authorities, or content protection organizations; (ii) protect and defend the legal rights, privacy, safety or property of Ketto, its affiliates, subsidiaries, employees, agents, contractors, or its users; (iii) permit us to pursue available remedies, commence, participate in, or defend litigation, or limit the damages we may sustain; or (iv) enforce this Privacy Policy or any applicable Terms of Service.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the 'Cookies and other electronic technologies' section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our website, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the website. We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

Google Ads Settings page

Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

We may also collect information through customer support communications, your communication to us of ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, with publicly-accessible information, ""Unsolicited Information""). By sending us Unsolicited Information, you further (a) agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Unsolicited Information, (b) acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Unsolicited Information already under consideration or in development, (c) grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the Unsolicited Information, and (iv) irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Ketto and its users any claims and assertions of any moral rights contained in such Unsolicited Information.

Do-Not-Track Signals

We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit.

Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit.

(You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the 'Cookies and other electronic technologies' section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our website, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the website. We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

We may also collect information through customer support communications, your communication to us of ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, with publicly-accessible information, ""Unsolicited Information""). By sending us Unsolicited Information, you further (a) agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Unsolicited Information, (b) acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Unsolicited Information already under consideration or in development, (c) grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the Unsolicited Information, and (iv) irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Ketto and its users any claims and assertions of any moral rights contained in such Unsolicited Information.

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics.

The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.

We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.

In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our website, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the website. We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

for EU based advertising or for US based advertising either: (i) the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer Opt-Out
link
or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out
link
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

By sending us Unsolicited Information, you further (a) agree that we are under no obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Unsolicited Information, (b) acknowledge that we may have something similar to the Unsolicited Information already under consideration or in development, (c) grant us an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the Unsolicited Information, and (iv) irrevocably waive, and cause to be waived, against Ketto and its users any claims and assertions of any moral rights contained in such Unsolicited Information.

For example, limiting access to information only to employees and authorized service providers who need to know such information for the purposes of this Privacy Notice. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any information to Ketto via the Internet.
Do-Not-Track Signals
Do Not Track (""DNT"") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.

Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit.

We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the 'Cookies and other electronic technologies' section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above.

We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics.

The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.

We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.

Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the 'Cookies and other electronic technologies' section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above.

We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

This information may be used to place interest-based advertisements on the Platform. This may result in you seeing advertisements for our Platform when you visit other websites. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
Tailored Advertising
We may use third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on our Platform, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised on our Platform may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the website as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our website, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the website. We may provide our customer information (such as a hashed version of your email addresses) to service providers, who may ""match"" this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to target or ""retarget"" you with ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. (You may opt out of these many of these service providers as described in the next paragraph.)
We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access our website by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below.
If you receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser, you can learn more about such tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, by visiting the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Ad Choices

or (ii) the Digital Advertising Alliance's Consumer Opt-Out
link
to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
Google Ads Settings page
.
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into our website or other websites that you visit, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

You can get in touch with the individual directly using the contact us button. The beneficiary if interested can also list their no on the campaign page if they wish to.
